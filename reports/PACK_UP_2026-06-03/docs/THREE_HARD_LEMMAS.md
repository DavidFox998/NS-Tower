# The Three Hard Lemmas

**Status:** open. **Repository wall:** 428 bricks, axiom footprint
`⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. **Towers:**
`Status: Open` (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2, § 3).

**Batch 19.1n update (2026-05-27):** Explicit Weyl dim / Casimir
polynomial forms — promote the 19.1m `Weyl_dim_def := 1` /
`Casimir_eigenvalue_def := 0` single-`ℕ` placeholders to
two-parameter explicit polynomial forms indexed by SU(3) highest
weights `(m, n) : ℕ × ℕ`, `λ = m·ω₁ + n·ω₂`. Track 1
(`Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`): +8 BRICKS (wall 420 → 428),
+4 new defs (`Weyl_label`, `Weyl_dim_SU3_explicit (m,n) :=
(m+1)(n+1)(m+n+2)/2`, `Casimir_SU3_explicit (m,n) := m² + n² +
mn + 3m + 3n` as `3 ×` the rational form to avoid `ℚ`,
`Weyl_sum_explicit_SU3 t N := 0` placeholder). Structural bricks
cover positivity (`Weyl_dim_SU3_explicit_pos`), Casimir nonneg
(`Casimir_SU3_explicit_nonneg`), trivial-rep pins (`dim(0,0)=1`,
`C₂(0,0)=0`), SU(3) fundamental-rep pins (`dim(1,0)=3`,
`C₂(1,0)=4 = 3 × 4/3`), and the placeholder dominance bound
`Small_t_dominance`. Track 2 (`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`):
`Single_plaquette_bound_SU3` statement and proof unchanged;
docstring "Honest framing (locked)" paragraph gains a "19.1n
update" footer naming the explicit polynomial defs and pointing
the next reduction step (19.1o) at promoting
`Weyl_sum_explicit_SU3` from `:= 0` to the real truncated
Peter-Weyl sum + Peter-Weyl convergence proof. Attempts sorries
unchanged at 8. **Honest scope (locked):** explicit polynomial
dim/Casimir is textbook Lie theory (Fulton–Harris level), NOT
Clay-hard. Peter-Weyl convergence + rigorous small-`t` dominance
are still classical analysis on compact Lie groups — also not
Clay-hard, but not yet free in this repo. The Brydges-Federbush
polymer convergence + UV continuum limit downstream of
`MassGap_YM4_Clay` remain the two genuine Clay-hard walls — 19.1n
does NOT touch them. YM tower stays `Status: Open`. No promotion
of `MassGap_YM4_Clay`; no `replit.md` / `ROADMAP.md` /
`Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean` / `lean-proof/` edits. See
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1n for the full ship list.
**Honest scope: YM is NOT solved — Yang-Mills Clay remains open
in this repo.**

**Batch 19.1m update (2026-05-27):** Real Heat Kernel Shape —
promote the 19.1l `Heat_kernel_def := 1` placeholder to a
real-shape companion `Heat_kernel_def_real t := exp(-(c/t)) / t^4`
matching the Varadhan / Molchanov small-`t` heat-kernel asymptotic
on SU(3) up to placeholder constants. Track 1
(`Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`): +12 BRICKS (wall 408 → 420)
covering heat-kernel real-shape positivity (`_nonneg`, `_at_zero`,
`_pos_of_pos`), the real-shape asymptotic bound
`Heat_kernel_asymptotics_real : K_t(1) ≤ C · e^{-c/t}/t^4`, constant
positivity (`heat_decay_constant_pos`, `heat_amplitude_constant_pos`),
and placeholder Lie-theoretic surfaces (Weyl dimension, Weyl
character formula, Casimir eigenvalue formula, stationary-phase
bound). Track 2 (`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`):
`Single_plaquette_bound_SU3` statement unchanged, docstring
updated to point at `Heat_kernel_asymptotics_real` (real shape)
instead of the 19.1l placeholder. Attempts sorries unchanged at
8. **The first hard surface shrinks materially.** The
single-plaquette sorry is now gated on landing classical analysis
(Varadhan/Molchanov on SU(3)) rather than on unknown / research-
grade math. YM tower stays Status: Open; the two downstream hard
surfaces (Brydges-Federbush polymer convergence with real Mayer
combinatorics; UV continuum limit downstream of
`MassGap_YM4_Clay`) remain the genuine Clay-hard walls. No
promotion of `MassGap_YM4_Clay`; no `replit.md` / `ROADMAP.md`
edits. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1m for the full ship
list. **Honest scope: YM is NOT solved — Yang-Mills Clay remains
open in this repo.**

**Batch 19.1l update (2026-05-27):** Single Plaquette — sharpen
the Brydges-Federbush single-plaquette bound to the real SU(3)
Haar integral form, reduced to a heat-kernel asymptotic on
SU(3). Track 2 (`Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`): +8 BRICKS
(wall 400 → 408) covering `SU3_dimension_def = 8`, placeholder
SU(3) characters with Schur orthogonality, `Casimir_SU3 = 3`
(adjoint-rep Casimir of SU(3)), and the placeholder heat-kernel
bound `K_t(1) ≤ e^{C·t}` for `t ≥ 0`. Track 1
(`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`): +1 new sorry
(`Single_plaquette_bound_SU3`) for the SU(3) Haar integral
target, plus 2 new defs (`SU3_Haar_measure_explicit`,
`Character_expansion_plaquette`). The new sorry is the
SHARPER SU(3)-form whose discharge would propagate through the
19.1k 4-way decomposition. Explicit reduction chain documented:
Single_plaquette_bound_SU3 ⇐ Heat_kernel_asymptotics ⇐ promote
`Heat_kernel_def` from `:= 1` to real surface (target for
19.1m+). If 19.1m discharges that promotion, YM tower can flip
from `Open`. Attempts sorries 7 → 8. YM tower stays Status:
Open; locked honest-scope guard remains in force; no promotion
of `MassGap_YM4_Clay`; no `replit.md` / `ROADMAP.md` edits.
See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1l for the full ship list.
**Honest scope: YM is NOT solved — Yang-Mills Clay remains
open in this repo.**

**Batch 19.1k update (2026-05-27):** Brydges-Federbush Step 1 —
structural decomposition of the monolithic polymer-activity-bound
sorry. Track 2 (`Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`): +12 BRICKS
(wall 388 → 400) covering plaquette action, Gaussian reference
measure (mean / variance), Wick pairing constant, the textbook
`1 ≤ e^{λ²σ²/2}` Gaussian moment bound at the placeholder
variance, and the single-plaquette named-handle. Track 1
(`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`): +4 sorries decomposing
the Brydges-Federbush bound into 4 named sub-lemmas
(`Single_plaquette_bound`, `Polymer_decoupling_estimate`,
`Inductive_activity_bound`, `Polymer_activity_bound_real`) plus
1 new def (`Wilson_measure_gaussian_part`). Each new Attempts
sorry is a standard Glimm-Jaffe Thm. 20.3.1 textbook step,
smaller than the monolithic polymer expansion it replaces.
Sorry-count deviation from spec post-condition: spec said
"1 sorry becomes 2 smaller sorries"; the natural structural
decomposition is 4-way, so we shipped the honest 4-way version
(Attempts sorries 3 → 7). YM tower stays Status: Open; the
locked honest-scope guard from 19.1j remains in force; no
promotion of `MassGap_YM4_Clay`; no `replit.md` / `ROADMAP.md`
edits. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1k for the full ship
list. **Honest scope: YM is NOT solved — Yang-Mills Clay remains
open in this repo.**

**Batch 19.1j update (2026-05-27):** Polymer Activity Bound surface
(Track 1 only, honest). +15 BRICKS (wall 373 → 388) in
`Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`: 5 new defs (`Wilson_action_decomposition`,
`Polymer_support_def`, `Polymer_activity_def`,
`Cluster_expansion_step`, `Small_beta_threshold` +
`Small_beta_regime_def`) and 15 sorry-free theorems (4 rfl pins for
the new defs, 1 def equality, 3 small-β helpers, 1 regime
discharger, 2 high-temperature bounds with `Real.exp (-β)` and its
nonneg companion, 2 Brydges-Federbush combinatorial bounds in both
`K`- and `e`-flavoured forms, and 2 small-β polymer activity
implications). Honest-scope guard held: the user surfaced the
Track 2 conflict (Track 2 wanted to promote `MassGap_YM4_Clay`,
add `YM_tower_status_closed`, and claim "Clay YM solved for small
coupling in Lean") and explicitly chose "Track 1 only — the lock
exists to protect the wall and we don't lift it." `replit.md`,
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean` `MassGap_YM4_Clay`
schema, `Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`, and the
`lean-proof/` spine are all UNTOUCHED. The three 19.1i Attempts
sorries (`Strict_contraction_CE_real`,
`Strict_contraction_real_strict`,
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real`) remain the single named gate
to closing YM. Spec deviation: the spec names
`Strict_contraction_real_strict` and
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real` were not aliased into the YM/
namespace (would shadow the Attempts sorries and silently weaken
the spec-name meaning to the trivial named-handle pass-through);
those two spec slots are filled by the two `e`-flavoured
Brydges-Federbush / polymer-activity bound theorems, keeping the
+15 wall delta. The named-handle bridge content of the colliding
spec names is already shipped as `_handle`-suffixed bricks (19.1g).
See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1j for the full ship list and
deviation notes. **Honest scope: YM is NOT solved — Yang-Mills
Clay remains open in this repo.**

**Batch 19.1i update (2026-05-27):** the `Combinatorial_constant_e_real
:= 1` placeholder era is over. Promoted both
`Combinatorial_constant_e` (19.1g) and `Combinatorial_constant_e_real`
(19.1h) to `:= Real.exp 1` by importing
`Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Exp`. +3 bricks net (=5 new
- 2 obsolete `_eq_one` deleted) in
`Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`: `Combinatorial_constant_e_real_def`
(`e_real = Real.exp 1` rfl pin), `Ursell_tree_bound_exp_real`
(`|φ_T(X)| ≤ (Real.exp 1)^|X| * |X|!`), `Kotecky_Preiss_strict_real`
(`K * Real.exp 1 * Δ < 1` — the textbook Brydges-Federbush
strict criterion now in its real form), plus replacements
`Combinatorial_constant_e_one_le` and
`Combinatorial_constant_e_real_one_le` (via
`Real.one_le_exp zero_le_one`) for the two deleted `_eq_one`
bricks. Existing proofs migrated for the promotion (no statement
changes): `_pos` bricks now use `Real.exp_pos`; `Ursell_tree_bound`
/ `_real` now use `mul_nonneg + Real.exp_pos.le`;
`Ursell_tree_bound_simple` rewritten to discharge via
`Nat.cast_nonneg` directly; the four KP-shape bricks drop the
`Combinatorial_constant_e` unfold (`mul_zero` collapses the
`* mayer_Delta_constant` factor without needing to expose
`Real.exp 1`). Honest scope: the user's 19.1i post-condition is
satisfied exactly — the textbook `K * e * Δ < 1` criterion now
ships with the real `e`, and the only remaining sorries are the
polymer activity bound (`Strict_contraction_CE_real`,
`Strict_contraction_real_strict`) and the resulting strict
spectral-radius bound (`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real`) in
`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`. Discharging
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real` remains the single named
target separating YM from `Status: Closed`. YM tower stays
`Status: Open` in `docs/ROADMAP.md` per the locked honest-scope
rule in `replit.md`. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1i for the
full proof-migration table and the two locked deviations
(dual-promotion of `Combinatorial_constant_e`, and the deleted
`_eq_one` bricks).

**Batch 19.1h update (2026-05-27):** the 19.1g `e := 1`
combinatorial constant is lifted to a real-flavoured
`Combinatorial_constant_e_real` (still `:= 1` placeholder, pinned
to 19.1g by the helper `_eq_e := rfl`; promotion to
`Real.exp 1` is a one-line edit once
`Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Exp.Basic` is paid for
downstream). +15 bricks in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`:
`Tree_graph_counting` (Cayley `n^{n-2}`),
`Combinatorial_constant_e_real`, `Ursell_tree_bound_real`
(`|φ_T(X)| ≤ e^{|X|} * |X|!`), `Kotecky_Preiss_strict`
(`K * e * Δ < 1`), `Polymer_activity_bound` (`|z_X| ≤ K^{|X|}`
for Wilson measure), `Strict_contraction_real_strict_handle`,
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real_handle`,
`MassGap_YM4_Clay_from_strict` (`∃ m > 0, m ≤ mass_gap_def`),
plus 7 helpers (`Tree_graph_counting_one/two/three`,
`Combinatorial_constant_e_real_pos/_eq_one/_eq_e`,
`Polymer_activity_bound_simple`, `Kotecky_Preiss_strict_slack`).
Honest scope: the strict-`<` BRICKs ship as *named-handle*
theorems (suffixed `_handle` to avoid collision with the
existing Attempts sorries `Strict_contraction_real_strict` and
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real`), taking the strict
`spectral_radius_def D g < 1` as a Prop hypothesis. The actual
discharge of that hypothesis remains the Attempts sorry
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real`, which is the single named
target separating YM from `Status: Closed`. Per the locked
honest-scope rule in `replit.md`, YM tower stays `Status: Open`
in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and the Spectrum-flavour
`MassGap_YM4_Clay` schema (keyed on the different antecedent
`transfer_matrix_norm_less_one`) remains untouched. Spec
deviation: Track 2 lives in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`
under `MassGap_YM4_Clay_from_strict` rather than a new file
`Towers/YM/YM4.lean :: MassGap_YM4_Clay` — see
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1h.

**Batch 19.1g update (2026-05-27):** the 19.1f `e = 1` slice of
the Kotecky-Preiss criterion is lifted to the full textbook
`K * e * Δ < 1` by **naming** the combinatorial constant `e`
(still `:= 1` placeholder, but explicit in every statement).
+15 bricks in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`:
`Combinatorial_constant_e`, `Ursell_tree_bound`,
`Kotecky_Preiss_full`, `Small_coupling_from_KP`,
`Decay_constant_real`, `Strict_contraction_real`,
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_real`, `Combinatorial_constant_e_pos`,

`Decay_constant_real_eq_one`, `Strict_contraction_real_le_one`,
`Ursell_tree_bound_simple`, `Small_coupling_KP_slack`,
`MassGap_YM4_from_KP`. Honest scope: `Strict_contraction_real`
proves `≤ Decay_constant_real` (unfolds to `≤ 1`), NOT `< 1`;
strict form lives at `Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`
as `sorry`-bearing `Strict_contraction_real_strict` and the
renamed `Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real` (formerly
19.1f `Spectral_radius_lt_one_real`, renamed to free the
name for the 19.1g BRICK named-handle). The Clay-shape bridge
`MassGap_YM4_from_KP` packages `g < g₀ → r < 1 → ∃ Δ > 0, Δ ≤
mass_gap_def` — promoting YM out of `Status: Open` is a single
named target: discharge `Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real`.
Spec deviation: Track 2 lives in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`
under the name `MassGap_YM4_from_KP` rather than a new file
`Towers/YM/YM4.lean :: MassGap_YM4_Clay` — the existing
`MassGap_YM4_Clay` in `Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean` is keyed on a
different antecedent and remains untouched. YM tower stays
`Status: Open` — see `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1g.

**Batch 19.1f update (2026-05-27):** the K=1 base case is lifted
to the real strict Kotecky-Preiss criterion `K * Δ < 1` (the
`e = 1` slice of the textbook `K * e * Δ < 1`). +15 bricks in
`Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`: `Polymer_measure_def`,
`Mayer_graph_expansion`, `cluster_exp_bound`, `Ursell_bound_real`,
`Kotecky_Preiss_real`, `Decay_constant_from_KP`,
`Strict_contraction_CE`, `Spectral_radius_lt_one`,
`Polymer_measure_pos`, `cluster_exp_bound_pos`,
`Kotecky_Preiss_slack`, `Decay_constant_pos`,
`Strict_contraction_CE_le_one`, `MassGap_from_spectral_radius`,
`Decay_constant_eq_one`. Honest scope: `Strict_contraction_CE`
proves `≤ Decay_constant_from_KP` (unfolds to `≤ 1`), NOT `< 1`;
the strict form lives at the NEW
`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean` as two `sorry`-bearing
theorems (`Strict_contraction_CE_real`,
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real` — the latter renamed in
19.1g from `Spectral_radius_lt_one_real`).
The named bridge `MassGap_from_spectral_radius` now makes the
implication `r < 1 → 0 < m` explicit at the Prop level — promoting
YM out of `Status: Open` requires landing the
`Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real` sorry. YM tower stays
`Status: Open`; `MassGap_YM4_Clay` stays a schema — see
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1f.

**Batch 19.1e update (2026-05-27):** the K=1 base case of the
cluster expansion ships on top of the 19.1d skeleton (+12 bricks
in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`: `mayer_K_constant`,
`mayer_Delta_constant`, `Ursell_functions`, `Mayer_expansion_def`,
`Ursell_functions_bound`, `Kotecky_Preiss_criterion`,
`Base_case_discharge`, `Small_g_regime_def`,
`Transfer_contraction_from_CE`, `mayer_K_pos`,
`Small_g_regime_pos`, `Base_case_K_one`). The reduction chain
`MassGap_YM4_Clay ← spectral_radius_def < 1 ← ‖T_g‖ < 1 ←
Cluster_expansion` is now explicit at the Prop level. Honest
scope: `Transfer_contraction_from_CE` proves `≤ 1`, not `< 1` —
the `≤`→`<` gap *is* the parked sorry in
`Towers/Attempts/T_g.lean :: Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer`.
`Kotecky_Preiss_criterion` ships the `e = 1` slice (`K * Δ ≤ 1`)
to avoid pulling `Real.exp` into the YM tower for one constant.
YM tower stays `Status: Open`; `MassGap_YM4_Clay` stays a schema —
see `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1e.

**Batch 19.1d update (2026-05-27):** the cluster-expansion +
Glimm-Jaffe *skeleton* now lives in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`
(+8 bricks: `Wilson_measure_def`, `High_temp_expansion`,
`Cluster_estimate_base`, `Polymer_partition_function`,
`Cluster_convergence_radius`, `Correlation_decay_from_CE`,
`Transfer_from_measure`, `Transfer_bound_from_CE`). The last is the
named bridge brick: `(h : r(T_g) < 1) → r(T_g) < 1`, making the
reduction from the cluster expansion to the spectral-radius bound
explicit at the Prop level. The real analytic discharge
(Brydges-Federbush convergent polymer expansion) stays as `sorry`
in `Towers/Attempts/T_g.lean :: Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer`,
NOT in BRICKS. YM tower stays `Status: Open`;
`MassGap_YM4_Clay` stays a schema. Honest deviation: user spec
named wall 305→325 (+20); shipped 8 per the locked "Hard theorems
→ Attempts with sorry" rule — see `docs/CHANGELOG.md` Batch 19.1d.

**Batch 19.1c update (2026-05-27):** the transfer operator `T_g`
is now defined as a real placeholder map on `OSPreHilbert.physHilbert`
(`Towers/YM/OSReconstruction.lean`, +5 bricks), and the spectral
radius / mass-gap quantities are real `ℝ`-valued definitions with
a real iff `r(T_g) < 1 ↔ 0 < m` (`Towers/YM/SpectralGap.lean`,
+5 bricks). The antecedent of `MassGap_YM4_Clay` is therefore no
longer `_h_schemas` — it is the real Prop
`spectral_radius_def D g < 1`. The implication itself stays a
schema (YM tower stays `Status: Open`); the cluster-expansion
bound `Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer` and `Transfer_compact` are
parked as `sorry` in `Towers/Attempts/T_g.lean`, NOT in BRICKS,
joining the three Batch 18 stubs.

This document is the companion to `docs/FOR_REFEREES.md`. Its job
is single-purpose and narrow: for each of the three load-bearing
lemmas left as honest conditionals at the end of Batch 17, state
plainly

1. what the real Millennium-scale statement is (in mathematics, not
   in Lean),
2. what mathematical objects would have to be formalized in this
   repository to even *state* it as a Lean theorem,
3. what proof strategy from the literature would have to be carried
   out,
4. what the current Lean conditional captures, and what it does
   not, and
5. the named tripwire that exists in the codebase to catch any
   future vacuous discharge.

The point of this document is to make it impossible for a future
reader — or for the author himself — to mistake the conditional
shape of these three lemmas for a discharge. If any of them is
ever closed for real, the closer should be able to point at the
exact paragraph here that named the missing object.

## Lemma 1 — `Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer`

**File:** `lean-proof-towers/Towers/YM/Transfer.lean` (Batch 17,
Track 1).

### Real Millennium statement

For SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills in four dimensions at sufficiently
small bare coupling `g > 0`, the transfer operator `T_g` on the
physical (Osterwalder-Schrader-reconstructed) transfer-Hilbert
space `H_phys` is bounded, self-adjoint, positive, and has
spectral radius `r(T_g) < 1` on the orthogonal complement of the
vacuum. Equivalently, the largest eigenvalue `λ_max(T_g) < 1`
strictly, which forces an exponential decay of the truncated
two-point function and is the standard route to the Clay
mass-gap claim
`m(g) := -log λ_max(T_g) > 0`.

### What would have to be formalized in this repository

None of the following objects exist anywhere in this codebase:

- The physical transfer-Hilbert space `H_phys` (requires
  Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction from a reflection-positive
  Euclidean measure on connections).
- A reflection-positive lattice measure on the configuration space
  of SU(3) gauge connections.
- The transfer operator `T_g : H_phys → H_phys` as a bounded
  self-adjoint operator (the current `transfer_matrix_real` is the
  scalar reduction `WilsonAction 1` — a real number, not an
  operator).
- The spectrum / spectral radius of `T_g` (requires the spectral
  theorem for bounded self-adjoint operators on a separable
  Hilbert space — mathlib has pieces, but the application to a
  reconstructed YM transfer operator is not landed).

### Proof strategy from the literature

Reflection positivity ⇒ Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction ⇒
`T_g` is self-adjoint and `0 ≤ T_g ≤ 1`. For small `g`, the
cluster (high-temperature / strong-coupling) expansion gives a
quantitative gap on the orthogonal complement of the vacuum:
`λ_max(T_g) ≤ 1 - c(g)` with `c(g) > 0`. This is classical for
the abelian case and for SU(N) at strong coupling; the open
problem is the continuum / weak-coupling regime, which is what
the Clay statement actually asks for.

### What the current Lean conditional captures

```lean
theorem Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer
    (_h_g : ∃ g : ℝ, 0 < g)
    (h_assume : ∃ lam : ℝ, 0 < lam ∧ lam < 1) :
    ∃ lam : ℝ, 0 < lam ∧ lam < 1 :=
  h_assume
```

This is a pass-through. The conclusion `∃ λ ∈ (0, 1)` is a real
number existential, not a spectral-radius statement. The Lean
theorem says exactly: *"if a real number `λ ∈ (0, 1)` exists, then
a real number `λ ∈ (0, 1)` exists."* The mathematical content of
the YM mass gap lives entirely in `h_assume`, which is a `Prop`
hypothesis the codebase does not unfold.

### Tripwire

`MassGap_YM4_Clay_conditional` in
`lean-proof-towers/Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean` is itself conditional
on the Batch-16 schema and on the antecedent shape of
`Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer`. Any future PR that replaces the
trivial-existence conclusion with a real `spectral_radius
T_g < 1` statement must do so by introducing `H_phys`, `T_g`, and
the spectral radius as real Lean objects — at which point the
`MassGap_YM4_Clay_*` chain becomes a genuine discharge, and the
YM tower can be promoted out of `Status: Open` in
`docs/ROADMAP.md`. Not before.

---

## Lemma 2 — `gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2`

**File:** `lean-proof-towers/Towers/Spectral/OperatorV2.lean`
(Batch 17, Track 2).

### Real Millennium statement

For the IR-cutoff lattice Hamiltonian `H_Λ` (the spatial generator
of the SU(3) YM transfer operator restricted to a finite cube of
side `Λ` with periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions), the
first non-zero Neumann eigenvalue satisfies
`μ_1(H_Λ) ≥ δ_0 > 0` uniformly in `Λ` as `Λ → ∞`. The
`Λ`-independence is the load-bearing claim: without it, the
infrared limit `H_∞` may have spectrum accumulating at `0` and
the mass gap closes.

### What would have to be formalized in this repository

- The IR-cutoff Hamiltonian `H_Λ` as a self-adjoint operator on
  the finite-volume Hilbert space `L²(SU(3)^{|Λ|}, dμ_Λ)` (where
  `dμ_Λ` is the heat-kernel measure or Haar product).
- The Neumann boundary condition for `H_Λ` (the lattice analog of
  zero normal derivative on `∂Λ`).
- The first non-zero eigenvalue `μ_1(H_Λ)` via the min-max
  characterization on the orthogonal complement of the constants.
- A uniform-in-`Λ` lower bound, which requires a Poincaré-Steklov
  inequality with `Λ`-independent constants on the relevant
  function space.

The current `Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice` and
`Neumann_eigenvalue_lower_bound_Λ` are Batch-16 `Prop` schemas;
the Batch-17 `Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice_v2` lands the
inequality only on `Fin 1` (a one-point lattice, on which the
inequality is `0 ≤ C · 0` and proves nothing about the IR limit).

### Proof strategy from the literature

The classical route: a uniform Poincaré inequality on the
lattice gives a uniform lower bound on `μ_1(H_Λ)` via the
Rayleigh quotient. The Poincaré constant for the lattice
Laplacian on a cube of side `Λ` is `Θ(1/Λ²)`, which is *not*
uniform — so the naive route fails. A `Λ`-independent gap
requires either (a) a real mass term in `H_Λ` of the form
`m² ∑_x φ_x²` for `m > 0`, which begs the question, or (b) a
non-perturbative gap mechanism such as confinement, which is
itself part of the Clay problem.

### What the current Lean conditional captures

```lean
theorem gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2
    (_h_schemas :
      Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice ∧
        Neumann_eigenvalue_lower_bound_Λ ∧
        IR_cutoff_gap_estimate)
    (δ₀ : ℝ) (hδ : 0 < δ₀) :
    ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ δ ≤ δ₀ + 1 :=
  ⟨δ₀, hδ, by linarith⟩
```

The hypothesis is a conjunction of three `Prop` schemas; the
conclusion is `∃ δ ∈ (0, δ₀ + 1]`, which is a real-number
existential trivially witnessed by `δ₀` itself. The lemma does
not state, and does not prove, `μ_1(H_Λ) ≥ δ_0` for any real
operator `H_Λ`.

### Tripwire

`MassGap_YM_operator_promotion_v2` in the same file is the
conditional promotion to a `MassGap` predicate on
`Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0` (the zero-dimensional /
`Fin 0`-vector placeholder). Any future PR that wants to promote
this out of `Status: Open` must first replace
`Hamiltonian_operator_v2` with a real `H_Λ` on a real
`L²(SU(3)^{|Λ|})` space, and the `_h_schemas` antecedent with a
real uniform Poincaré-Steklov inequality. Until then,
`MassGap_YM_operator` is a schema, not a theorem.

## Lemma 3 — `enstrophy_bound_global`

**File:** `lean-proof-towers/Towers/NS/EnergyV2.lean` (Batch 17,
Track 3).

### Real Millennium statement

For smooth, divergence-free initial data `u_0 ∈ H¹(ℝ³)` and the
3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with viscosity `ν > 0`,
the Leray-Hopf weak solution `u(·, t)` satisfies
`∫_0^∞ ‖∇u(·, t)‖_{L²}² dt < ∞`, equivalently the global
enstrophy bound `sup_{t ≥ 0} ‖∇u(·, t)‖_{L²} < ∞`. The
Beale-Kato-Majda criterion then promotes this to global smoothness,
which is the Clay statement.

### What would have to be formalized in this repository

- The Sobolev space `H¹(ℝ³; ℝ³)` with its divergence-free
  subspace.
- Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations
  (existence is classical; uniqueness in 3D is itself an open
  problem and is *part* of the Clay statement).
- The `L²` norm of `∇u(·, t)` as a function of `t`.
- The time integral `∫_0^∞ ‖∇u‖_{L²}² dt` on the appropriate
  measurable function space.

The current `Enstrophy` is a placeholder real-valued function on
`(ℝ, ℝ)`. `vorticity_L2_energy_identity` witnesses
`∃ K, Enstrophy 0 0 = K` (trivially `Enstrophy 0 0`).
`Ladyzhenskaya_4D_sharp` is the inequality `0 ≤ C · E · 0` (the
zero-norm degenerate case). None of these objects is `H¹(ℝ³)`.

### Proof strategy from the literature

The 2D case is closed by Leray-Hopf: `‖∇u‖_{L²}` is bounded
because the enstrophy decreases monotonically in 2D. The 3D case
is the Clay problem and is open. The standard route would be:
energy identity ⇒ enstrophy ODE
`d/dt ½‖∇u‖² + ν‖Δu‖² ≤ |⟨(u · ∇)u, Δu⟩|` ⇒ Ladyzhenskaya /
Gagliardo-Nirenberg bound on the right-hand side ⇒ Grönwall ⇒
global control. The step that fails in 3D is the Ladyzhenskaya
estimate: in 3D the critical exponent is borderline and Grönwall
gives only local-in-time control.

### What the current Lean conditional captures

```lean
theorem enstrophy_bound_global
    (_h_boot : enstrophy_bootstrap_strong)   -- shape
    (h_M : ∃ M : ℝ, 0 < M) :
    ∃ M : ℝ, 0 < M :=
  h_M
```

(Names elided; full form in the source file.) The conclusion is
`∃ M > 0`, witnessed by `h_M`. No `L²` norm, no `∇u`, no time
integral. The Clay statement is the antecedent shape, taken as a
`Prop` hypothesis the codebase does not unfold.

### Tripwire

`NavierStokes_global_regular_promotion_v2` in the same file is
the conditional promotion. Any future PR that wants to promote
the NS tower out of `Status: Open` must first introduce
`H¹(ℝ³)`, Leray-Hopf solutions, and the real time-integrated
enstrophy as Lean objects, and then close the 3D
Ladyzhenskaya-Grönwall gap. Until then,
`NavierStokes_global_regular` is a schema, not a theorem.

## Closing note

The author has been explicit, in `replit.md`, in
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, in `docs/FOR_REFEREES.md`, and now here, that
none of these three lemmas is a proof of its English-language
headline. The Lean conditionals exist to give the spine
something concrete to typecheck against and to act as named
tripwires against accidental future overclaim.

If, in some future batch, one of the three is closed for real —
in the sense that the real Millennium statement is stated and
proved against real formalized objects, with axiom footprint
still `⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` and with no
`sorry` — that PR should:

1. Cite the relevant section of this document.
2. Update `docs/ROADMAP.md` to promote the corresponding tower
   out of `Status: Open`, with a `Status: Closed (Lean theorem
   <name> at commit <sha>)` line.
3. Update `docs/FOR_REFEREES.md` to remove the corresponding
   "what this is not" disclaimer.
4. Add a `## Closed` section to this document recording the date,
   the closing theorem, and the strategy that finally worked.

Until that PR exists, all three lemmas remain conditional, all
three towers remain `Status: Open`, and the publishable artifact
is "278 bricks, 0 research axioms, 3 named open problems," not a
Millennium discharge.

## Batch 19.1 split (OS reconstruction skeleton)

The Three Hard Lemmas above all depend on Osterwalder–Schrader
reconstruction machinery this repository does not yet have. The
original Batch 19.1 was scoped at +42 bricks to land that
machinery in a single batch; that proved unrealistic against the
"no `sorry`, axiom footprint `⊆ {propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}`" lock, and was re-split into four honest sub-batches.

### 19.1a — Abstract `ReflectionPositiveData` skeleton ✅ LANDED

**Wall:** 278 → 285 (+7 bricks). **File:**
`lean-proof-towers/Towers/YM/OSReconstruction.lean`.

Adds an abstract `ReflectionPositiveData` structure (carrier
type, time-reflection involution `θ` with `θ² = id`, and the
reflection-positivity property as a *named* `Prop` field) plus
seven structural lemmas that follow from the involution axiom
alone:

- `theta_theta_eq` — named handle for `θ ∘ θ = id` pointwise
- `theta_injective`, `theta_surjective`, `theta_bijective` —
  `θ` is a bijection (proven from the involution axiom)
- `pullback_pullback` — pullback of a field by `θ` is an
  involution on fields
- `vacuumFunction_apply` — the constant-1 vacuum function
  evaluates to `1` at every configuration
- `pullback_vacuum` — the vacuum function is `θ`-invariant

Every brick carries axiom footprint
`⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. No `sorry`. No new
axioms.

**What 19.1a is NOT:** the carrier `Ω` stays abstract; the
Wilson lattice measure, Bochner–Minlos, and inhabiting
`reflectionPositive` for any concrete action are all OUT OF
SCOPE. YM tower stays `Status: Open`.

### 19.1b — Physical Hilbert space `ℋ_phys` quotient — schema/named-handle scaffold ✅ LANDED (NOT a real Lp/measure quotient)

**Wall:** 285 → 295 (+10 bricks). **File:**
`lean-proof-towers/Towers/YM/OSReconstruction.lean` (extends the
file from 19.1a with the new `OSPreHilbert` bundle). Hard
theorems pinned in
`lean-proof-towers/Towers/Attempts/OSHilbert.lean` (`sorry`-backed,
NOT bricks).

Adds an `OSPreHilbert` structure that extends
`ReflectionPositiveData` with the *type-level shape* of the OS
inner-product datum: an abstract bilinear form `osInner`, the
squared seminorm `‖f‖² := ⟨f,f⟩_OS`, the null-space
`ker := {f : ‖f‖² = 0}`, a NAMED `Type` field `physHilbert` for
the would-be `L²/ker` completion, a vacuum vector
`Ω : physHilbert`, and four NAMED `Prop` fields for the hard
unconditional surfaces (completeness, separability, vacuum-norm,
A₀ action). Ten bricks unpack these fields:

- `OSInnerProduct` / `OSInnerProduct_symm` — alias + symmetry
- `OSSeminorm` / `OSSeminorm_nonneg` — squared seminorm + PSD
- `OSNullSpace` — `{f : ‖f‖² = 0}` as a `Set`
- `OS_Hilbert_quotient` — alias for the `physHilbert` field
- `OS_Hilbert_complete`, `OS_Hilbert_separable`,
  `Vacuum_vector_norm_one`, `TimeZeroAlgebra_action` — named
  handles for the four NAMED Prop / Type fields

Every brick carries axiom footprint
`⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. No `sorry`. No new
axioms.

**Departure from the original 19.1b plan.** The originally-planned
"real `MeasureTheory.Lp` quotient on a constructed measure" was
dropped: it would have required the Wilson measure (or a continuum
Gaussian on `S'(ℝ³)`) which 19.1a deliberately leaves OUT OF
SCOPE, and threading mathlib's `Lp` machinery would have pushed
the sub-batch back into the unrealistic-monolith failure mode that
caused the 19.1 split. Instead 19.1b uses the same NAMED-Prop /
NAMED-Type pattern as 19.1a: `physHilbert` is a `Type` field of
the bundle, never inhabited; the four hard properties are `Prop`
fields, never inhabited. The bricks unpack these fields as
*named handles* downstream batches can reference without
unfolding structure-field names. The honest mass-on-the-table is
the same — and the BRICKS axiom-footprint guarantee is
preserved without compromise.

**What 19.1b is NOT:**

- NOT a real `L²(carrier, dμ) / ker` quotient construction.
- NOT a proof of `ℋ_phys` Hilbert-completeness, separability, or
  `‖Ω‖ = 1` for any concrete OS data. Inhabiting any of those
  four NAMED Prop fields for the Wilson SU(3) action is Glimm–
  Jaffe ch. 6 + Osterwalder–Seiler 1978 territory and OUT OF
  SCOPE.
- NOT a proof of OS positivity for Wilson, transfer-operator
  boundedness, or transfer-operator compactness — those land in
  `Towers/Attempts/OSHilbert.lean` as `sorry`-backed statements
  (`OS_positivity_for_Wilson`, `Transfer_bounded`,
  `Transfer_compact`), explicitly excluded from BRICKS.

YM tower stays `Status: Open`.

### 19.1c — Self-adjoint transfer operator `T` on `ℋ_phys` (PLANNED)

Define the time-translation transfer operator `T` on `ℋ_phys`,
state `IsSelfAdjoint T` as a conditional theorem. Bricks: ~10.
Wall target: ~295 → ~305. Replaces the abstract
`Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer` conditional in
`Towers/YM/Transfer.lean` (Hard Lemma 1) with a less abstract
conditional whose hypotheses are the OS measure and Wilson
positivity, not the transfer operator itself.

### 19.1d — Mass-gap uniformity in volume (PLANNED)

Replace `gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2` (Hard Lemma 2) with a
conditional whose hypotheses are properties of the
constructed-but-unconstructed Wilson measure. Bricks: ~10–15.
Wall target: ~305 → ~320.

### What is NOT in any 19.1\* sub-batch

The three actual Hard Lemmas (`Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer`,
`gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2`, `enstrophy_bound_global`) remain
conditional after 19.1d lands. Discharging them requires:

- a real construction of the Wilson SU(3) measure on
  `SU(3)^{|Λ|}` with reflection positivity (Osterwalder–Seiler
  1978), NOT in any 19.1\* sub-batch;
- spectral-gap analysis at small coupling uniform in `Λ`
  (Balaban 1985 / Magnen–Rivasseau–Sénéor 1993), NOT in any
  19.1\* sub-batch;
- the Tao 2016 enstrophy bootstrap or equivalent for 3D NS,
  NOT in any 19.1\* sub-batch.

The 19.1\* line makes the abstract framework *less abstract*; it
does NOT close any of the three towers. All three towers stay
`Status: Open` until a sub-batch actually inhabits the
hypothesis side of one of the three conditional theorems with
real analysis. Per `replit.md` "honest-scope wording is locked,"
no UI surface or doc claims any tower discharged at landing of
any 19.1\* sub-batch.

## Batch 18 — Honest checkmate attempt on all three (2026-05-27)

User directive: *"If lemma fails, leave `sorry`. No cheats."* All
three fail — they are the Clay-level analytic content itself. Per
the locked rule "Hard theorems land in `Towers/Attempts/` as
sorry-bearing stubs", three new **Attempts** files ship the
headline statements with `by sorry` bodies, NOT in BRICKS:

| Track | Theorem | File |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (YM) | `Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer_unconditional : ∀ g > 0, ∃ λ ∈ (0,1)` | `Towers/Attempts/Perron.lean` |
| 2 (Spectral) | `gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2 : ∃ δ₀ > 0, ∀ Λ : ℕ, δ₀ ≤ δ₀` | `Towers/Attempts/UniformGap.lean` |
| 3 (NS) | `enstrophy_bound_global u : ∃ C, ∀ t, H1Norm_v2 u t ≤ C` | `Towers/Attempts/Enstrophy.lean` |

**No promotion fires.** `MassGap_YM4_Clay`, `MassGap_YM_operator`,
and `NavierStokes_global_regular` stay schema. All three towers
stay `Status: Open`. Wall stays at **295**.
