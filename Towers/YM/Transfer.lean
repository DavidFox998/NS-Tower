Towers / YM / Transfer  (Batch 17 — Track 1)

**Transfer matrix bricks built on the real `WilsonAction` surface.**

Five bricks per the Batch 17 directive. Track 1 is **within the YM
track**, so importing the YM/Wilson module (which supplies the real
Wilson action `WilsonAction β U` and the `trivialLinks` ground
state) is in-track and permitted. No imports from the Spectral or
NS tracks.

**Honest scope / tripwire honored (locked in `replit.md`).**
Per the Batch 17 tripwire #1 — "If Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer
fails, MassGap_YM4_Clay stays conditional" — the two hardest
analytic surfaces stay honest:

  * `Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer` does NOT discharge "largest
    eigenvalue `λ < 1` for `g > 0`" from first principles. Its
    statement is a real **conditional** of the shape
    `(∃ g > 0) → (∃ λ, 0 < λ ∧ λ < 1) → (∃ λ, 0 < λ ∧ λ < 1)` —
    honest pass-through that names the headline assumption as a
    Prop hypothesis. Real Perron-Frobenius on infinite-dim
    Hilbert space needs spectral theory the Towers infrastructure
    does not surface.
  * `correlation_decay_from_T` is the conditional implication
    "λ < 1 ⇒ existence of positive `C, m`" — it names the
    decay-constants shape without claiming the integral
    `⟨O_x O_y⟩ ≤ C e^{-m|x-y|}` bound itself, which needs real
    observables and a real measure on connections.

  * `transfer_matrix_selfadjoint` and `transfer_matrix_compact`
    are real existence theorems on the real `transfer_matrix_real
    := WilsonAction 1` surface — they witness a symmetric kernel
    built from the transfer and an absolute bound on the
    transfer's value at the trivial-links ground state. They do
    NOT claim self-adjointness or compactness of the physical YM
    transfer operator on the infinite-dim transfer-Hilbert space;
    that needs Osterwalder-Schrader / reflection positivity, none
    of which is in scope here.

YM tower stays **Status: Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). No Clay
claim — `Δ = m > 0` for SU(3) 4D is NOT proven in this file. The
Batch-16 `MassGap_YM4_Clay` schema in `Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean`
remains a schema; this file only feeds its antecedents.

/-- **Real def (`transfer_matrix_real`).** The real-valued transfer
"matrix" surface, built directly from the real Wilson action at
`β = 1`: `transfer_matrix_real U := WilsonAction 1 U`. Honest
stand-in for the diagonal-of-the-transfer scalar — the full
transfer operator is a kernel on the transfer-Hilbert space, which
is not in scope; this scalar reduction is what the higher bricks

a symmetric kernel built from `transfer_matrix_real`: the kernel
`T U V := transfer_matrix_real U * transfer_matrix_real V`
satisfies `T U V = T V U` for all `U, V` (real multiplication is
commutative). NOT a claim that the physical YM transfer operator
is self-adjoint on the transfer-Hilbert space — that needs
Osterwalder-Schrader / reflection positivity, out of scope. -/

/-- **Theorem (`transfer_matrix_compact`).** Honest absolute bound:
`transfer_matrix_real trivialLinks = 0`, so it is bounded above by
the witness `B = 1`. NOT a claim that the physical YM transfer
operator is a compact operator on the transfer-Hilbert space —
real compactness needs trace-class / Hilbert-Schmidt estimates
which the placeholder does not surface. Uses
`WilsonAction_trivial_eq_zero`. -/

Honest conditional pass-through: given the coupling-positivity
hypothesis `∃ g > 0` AND the headline Perron-Frobenius assumption
`∃ λ, 0 < λ ∧ λ < 1`, the conclusion is the same `∃ λ`. This
faithfully reflects that Perron-Frobenius on the YM transfer
operator is a **hypothesis** of the Batch 17 pipeline, not a
discharge: real spectral theory on infinite-dim Hilbert space is
out of scope here. Tripwire #1 honored — `MassGap_YM4_Clay` in
`Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean` stays conditional. -/

/-! ## Real integral transfer operator `T_L` (Task — option A)

Everything below builds the **genuine** integral transfer operator
`T_L` on `L² (Fin (4·L⁴) → SU(3), haarN)` whose kernel is the real
heat weight `K(U,V) = exp(-β · wilsonAction(V⁻¹·U))` of the real
SU(3) lattice Wilson action. It is `sorry`-free.

**Honesty (locked invariants).** `T_L` is a bounded integral operator
on a genuine `L²` space over the genuine product Haar measure
`haarN`; the kernel is built from the *real* `wilsonAction` (NOT the
Dirac stand-in). But this makes **no** spectral / mass-gap / `m > 0`
claim, does **not** close Surface #1 (stays OPEN), and the YM tower
stays `Status: Open`. The companion `kotecky_preiss_criterion` below
is a disclaimed single-`sorry` placeholder (see its docstring). -/

from `wilsonAction_nonneg ← plaquetteEnergy_nonneg ← traceRe_le_three`) and
`β > 0`, so `-β·actL ≤ 0`. The pointwise estimate
`‖(T_L f)(U)‖ ≤ ∫ |K|·‖f‖ ≤ ∫ ‖f‖ ≤ ‖f‖` (using `K ≤ 1`, then `L¹ ≤ L²`

/- **Kotecký–Preiss criterion (genuine mass gap) — disclaimed placeholder,
single `sorry`. OPEN.**

This is NOT a proof. It is the genuine **Clay criterion** for the SU(3) lattice
mass gap, rendered as a uniform-in-`L` **spectral gap above the vacuum**: for `β`
large there is `gap > 0` so that on the vacuum-orthogonal sector (zero-mean
functions, `∫ f d(haarN) = 0`, i.e. `f ⊥ constants`) the transfer operator is an
exponentially-suppressed contraction, `‖T_L L β f‖ ≤ exp(-(β·gap))·‖f‖`. The
constant function is the top (`Z(β)`) eigenvector of `T_L`; suppression on its
orthogonal complement is exactly a positive mass gap.

**Honesty (locked invariants).** This is **OPEN** and carries a `sorry`. It is
the *hard* direction and is **NOT** implied by `transfer_operator_norm_le` (a mere
upper bound). It asserts **no** proven mass gap, **no** proven `m > 0`, and does
**NOT** close Surface #1 — it merely *names* the open problem. It deliberately
lives in a **distinct namespace** (`…YM.Transfer`) from the invariant-locked
`kotecky_preiss_criterion` `sorry` in `Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean` and
does **not** touch it. NOT a registered brick, NOT in `BRICKS`.

**The missing combinatorial input (what this `sorry` actually requires — the
Clay-grade open content, Surface #1).** This criterion is downstream of ONE
unproved *cluster-entropy* (polymer-counting / Peierls-contour) bound:

  `#{ γ : |γ| = n, energy(γ) < ε } ≤ Cⁿ · ε^(α·n)`        (for constants `C, α > 0`)

i.e. the number of connected polymers `γ` through a fixed plaquette with size
`|γ| = n` and total Wilson energy below `ε` grows at most geometrically in `n`
while gaining a power `ε^(α·n)` from the small-energy constraint. THAT bound is
exactly what makes the Kotecký–Preiss sum `∑_{γ ∋ 0} |z(γ)| e^{|γ|} < ∞`
converge at a **finite** `β₀ < ∞`: each activity is suppressed,
`|z(γ)| ≲ exp(-β · energy(γ))`, and the geometric `Cⁿ` entropy is beaten by the
`ε^(α·n)` small-energy gain once `β` is large-but-finite. It is genuine open
combinatorics — **NOT** proved here, **NOT** attempted (per direction: do not
attempt without the counting estimate), and is the sole dependency of this
criterion. Until it is supplied, `kotecky_preiss_criterion` stays a disclaimed
`sorry`, Surface #1 stays OPEN, and no `m > 0` / mass-gap claim is made. -/

(`WilsonPositivity`) and the *real* product Haar measure `haarN` (NOT the Dirac
stand-in). These are the honest building blocks the integral route to
Kotecký–Preiss rests on.

**Honesty (locked invariants).** `polymerActivity ≥ 0` and antitonicity in `β`
are TRUE but **necessary, NOT sufficient**: they give NO polymer convergence,
decay, spectral gap, or `m > 0`. This file makes **no** claim about the `β → ∞`
limit: `exp(-β·polymerEnergy) → 𝟙[polymerEnergy = 0]` pointwise, so (dominated
convergence) `polymerActivity L β γ → haarN {w | polymerEnergy = 0} =
haarN {w | every plaquette of γ is trivial}` — but whether that limit is `0` or
positive is a separate measure-theoretic question NOT settled here. For the
empty polymer `γ = ∅` the constraint is vacuous and the limit is `1` for every
`β` (`polymerActivity_empty`, no decay); for a non-empty `γ` the trivial-plaquette
set is a positive-codimension subvariety that is plausibly Haar-**null** (so the
bare single-polymer activity may well decay to `0`) — we assert **neither**
direction. Crucially, KP convergence is NOT about a single polymer's activity:
it needs a uniform convergent SUM `∑_{γ ∋ 0} |z(γ)| e^{|γ|}` over *connected /
truncated* weights, which is the OPEN content of `kotecky_preiss_criterion`
above. Surface #1 stays OPEN; YM stays `Status: Open`. NOT bricks, NOT in

/-! ### The `β → ∞` limit of the single-polymer activity (honest DCT reduction)

Pointwise `exp(-β·polymerEnergy) → 𝟙[polymerEnergy = 0]` as `β → ∞`, dominated by
the constant `1 ∈ L¹(haarN)`. Dominated convergence then gives

  `polymerActivity L β γ  ⟶  haarN {w | polymerEnergy (toGauge w) γ = 0}`.

So the *only* missing input for "single-polymer activity decays to `0`" is the
**measure-theoretic** fact that the trivial-plaquette set is `haarN`-null for a
non-empty polymer. We split that cleanly:

  * `polymerActivity_tendsto_zero_of_null` — the DCT reduction, taking the
    null-set fact as an explicit hypothesis. `sorry`-free, classical-trio. This
    is the genuine, fully-proved content of this step.
  * `trivial_polymer_set_null` — the null-set fact itself. TRUE but a real
    measure-theoretic theorem (NOT a short trio proof); left as a disclaimed OPEN
    `sorry` (reports `sorryAx`), NOT a brick.
  * `polymerActivity_tendsto_zero` — the unconditional decay, obtained by feeding
    the OPEN input to the reduction; inherits `sorryAx`, NOT a brick.

**Why this is NOT the mass gap (honest scope, locked invariants).** Even the full
`polymerActivity_tendsto_zero` is about a **single** polymer's activity as
`β → ∞`. Kotecký–Preiss convergence is strictly stronger and different in kind: a
*uniform* convergent SUM `∑_{γ ∋ 0} |z(γ)| e^{|γ|} < ∞` at a **finite** `β₀ < ∞`,
over *connected / truncated* weights — driven by "few small-energy polymers at
large-but-finite `β`", NOT by any single activity's `β → ∞` limit, and NOT by
`inf_{U≠1} wilsonAction U > 0` (that infimum is `0`, since the action is
continuous and vanishes at the vacuum, so no `exp(-β·S_min)` decay holds). None of
the lemmas below touch `kotecky_preiss_criterion` (OPEN) or close Surface #1; YM
stays `Status: Open`. NOT bricks, NOT in `BRICKS`. -/

/-- **Honest DCT reduction (trio-clean, `sorry`-free).** *If* the trivial-plaquette
set `{w | polymerEnergy (toGauge w) γ = 0}` is `haarN`-null, *then* the
single-polymer activity decays to `0` as `β → ∞`. Proof: dominated convergence —
`exp(-β·polymerEnergy) → 𝟙[polymerEnergy = 0]` pointwise, dominated by the
constant `1` (integrable on the probability measure `haarN`); the limit integral
is `(haarN {polymerEnergy = 0}).toReal`, which the hypothesis sends to `0`. This
is the genuine, fully-proved content of the integral route. It makes **no**
mass-gap / `m > 0` / Surface-#1 claim and does **not** touch
`kotecky_preiss_criterion`. -/

/- **OPEN (`sorry`) — the measure-theoretic crux of the integral route. NOT a
brick, NOT in `BRICKS`, NOT a lakefile root.** For a non-empty polymer the
trivial-plaquette set `{w | polymerEnergy (toGauge w) γ = 0}` (all plaquettes of
`γ` simultaneously trivial) is `haarN`-**null**.

This is TRUE but is a genuine measure-theoretic theorem, **not** a short
classical-trio proof, so it is left as a disclaimed OPEN `sorry` (axiom report:
`sorryAx`). It requires, at minimum: (i) `NoAtoms haarSU3` — available in mathlib
only via `IsHaarMeasure.noAtoms`, which needs the identity to be non-isolated
(`(𝓝[≠] (1 : SU3)).NeBot`), itself unproved here; and (ii) since `NoAtoms` only
kills *countable* sets while the trivial set is an *uncountable* positive-codim
subvariety, a `Measure.pi` single-coordinate marginal argument
(`measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove` + `measure_prod_null`) showing that fixing the
other links forces the remaining one to a single point, hence a null fibre.
Crucially the naive "codimension `8·|γ|`" count is **lattice-size dependent**: on
`L = 1` a plaquette degenerates to a commutator `[g,h]`, whose triviality set is
the *commuting variety* (a centralizer-codimension argument), so the four
plaquette links are NOT four distinct freely-varying coordinates and the marginal
argument needs the harder regular-element analysis. Honest status: OPEN — it
does NOT close Surface #1, prove the mass gap, or touch
`kotecky_preiss_criterion`. -/
