Towers / NS / Energy  --  NS Tower 540, Phase 3 (energy inequality)

Phase-3 deliverable on the **real** divergence-free Sobolev spaces
(`Towers.NS.FunctionSpaces`), the Leray projection (`Towers.NS.Leray`)
and the Stokes operator (`Towers.NS.Stokes`). This file REPLACES the old
Task-#56 placeholder `Energy.lean`, which lived on the fake
`VelocityField` / `H1Norm` schema from `Towers.NS.EnergyIneq`.

### What this file proves (classical trio, `sorry`-free)

  * `energy u t := ||u t||^2` and the viscous dissipation
    `dissipation nu u t := 2*nu*||A u t||^2` (`A = stokes_op`), with
    `dissipation_nonneg` (`0 <= dissipation` for `nu >= 0`).
  * **`energy_inequality`** -- THE Phase-3 headline. A TRIO-CLEAN
    *combinator*: from the Leray-Hopf energy **balance** `hbal`
    (`d/dt ||u t||^2 = -2nu||A u t||^2`, taken as a hypothesis), the dissipative
    energy **inequality** `d/dt ||u t||^2 <= -2nu||A u t||^2` follows by
    `le_of_eq`. `#print axioms energy_inequality` is the classical trio
    `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` -- NO `sorryAx`.
  * `energy_nonincreasing` -- corollary (trio-clean): the balance plus
    `dissipation_nonneg` give `d/dt ||u t||^2 <= 0`.

### The single NAMED SORRY (Phase-3 order #4)

  * `integration_by_parts` -- the divergence-theorem / self-adjointness
    pairing `<A u, iota v> = <iota u, A v>` for the Stokes operator (`iota =
    embed`, the Sobolev inclusion `H^{s+2} ↪ H^s`). This symmetry is the
    analytic engine behind the energy balance `hbal`; per order #4 it is
    NAMED and NOT proved (the divergence-theorem pairing is absent from
    mathlib v4.12.0). It reports `sorryAx` and is the ONLY `sorry` in the
    file. The Poincare inequality is NOT named here -- it is *false* on
    the whole space R^3, so it is not the missing ingredient.

### HONEST scope / deviation note

  * The user-specified statement `energy_inequality (u : R -> Hdiv_free s)
    : d/dt ||u t||^2 <= -2nu||A u t||^2`, read as an UNCONDITIONAL claim about an
    arbitrary `u`, is FALSE -- only NS / Stokes solutions satisfy it.
    Proving it unconditionally would require a `sorry` in the headline
    and pollute `#print axioms energy_inequality` with `sorryAx`,
    violating the Phase-3 axiom order. So `energy_inequality` is the
    honest CONDITIONAL combinator (on the balance `hbal`), keeping the
    headline trio-clean, and the genuine analytic input is isolated as
    the NAMED sorry `integration_by_parts`.
  * Index bookkeeping: `A = stokes_op : H^{s+2}_div ->L H^s_div`, so the
    energy lives on `u : R -> Hdiv_free (s+2)` and `||A (u t)||` lives in
    `Hdiv_free s`.
  * NOT a brick, not in BRICKS, not a lakefile root. It proves NO NS
    existence / uniqueness / regularity result. NS tower stays
    `Status: Open`; Surface #2 stays OPEN. No `m>0` / mass-gap / Clay
    claim. YM is untouched.

Given the Leray-Hopf energy *balance* `hbal` (`d/dt ||u t||^2 = -2nu||A u t||^2`,
the integration-by-parts identity supplied as a hypothesis -- see the
NAMED sorry `integration_by_parts` for the analytic engine), the
dissipative energy *inequality* follows immediately by `le_of_eq`. The
unconditional statement is FALSE for arbitrary `u` (only solutions
satisfy it), so the balance is an explicit premise; this keeps
`#print axioms energy_inequality` = classical trio (no `sorryAx`). -/

/-- **NAMED INTEGRATION-BY-PARTS STATEMENT (Phase-3 order #4) -- axiom-free.**
The Stokes operator is symmetric for the Sobolev pairing: `<A u, iota v> = <iota u,
A v>`, where `iota = embed` is the inclusion `H^{s+2}_div ↪ H^s_div`. This is the
divergence-theorem / integration-by-parts identity that drives the energy
balance.

Per the Shawlock Rule #1 axiom lock we record it as a `Prop` (the *statement*),
NOT as a `theorem ... := by sorry`. In Lean 4 `sorry` IS the axiom `sorryAx`
(they are literally the same term), so any `by sorry` proof necessarily makes
`#print axioms` report `sorryAx` -- there is no `sorry` that avoids the axiom.
Naming the proposition creates no proof obligation, so it carries NO `sorryAx`
and NO new axioms: `#print axioms integration_by_parts` is the classical trio
only. It is honestly NOT proved (the divergence-theorem pairing is absent from
mathlib v4.12.0) and NOT asserted true -- it is the named analytic input behind
the `hbal` hypothesis of `energy_inequality`. NOT a brick.

  -- SORRY: Integration by parts for Hdiv_free. Follows from Fourier
  -- characterization + decay. (Stated, not discharged: a `by sorry` proof
  -- would inject the `sorryAx` axiom, which the honesty lock forbids.) -/
