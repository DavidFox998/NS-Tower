Towers / Attempts / UniformGap  (Batch 18 Track 2 — sorry-bearing stub)

**THIS FILE IS NOT A BRICK.** Deliberately excluded from BRICKS in
`scripts/check-towers.sh`. The theorem below is `sorry`-backed;
its `#print axioms` includes `sorryAx` and would fail the
{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} footprint — that is *why*
it is not a brick. Per locked rule in `replit.md`: "Hard theorems
land in `Towers/Attempts/` as sorry-bearing stubs."

## What this file pins

The **uniform-in-Λ spectral gap** for the YM Hamiltonian — the
Clay-level analytic surface that would close the YM mass-gap loop
once paired with `Towers.YM.OSReconstruction` and a real
`Towers.Spectral.OperatorV2` bundle.

  * `gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2` — there exists `δ₀ > 0` such that
    for every lattice cutoff `Λ : ℕ`, the spectral gap `Δ_Λ` of
    the Λ-restricted Hamiltonian satisfies `Δ_Λ ≥ δ₀`. The
    quantifier order (`∃ δ₀, ∀ Λ`) is the load-bearing one —
    pulling `δ₀` outside the cutoff is exactly what makes this
    the IR-uniform Poincaré bound + cutoff-independent Neumann
    eigenvalue bound the proof would need.

## Honest-scope reminder

YM tower stays `Status: Open` (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). The headline
target `MassGap_YM_operator` does NOT auto-promote: the schema in
`Towers.Spectral.OperatorV2` quantifies over a hypothetical lower
bound, and discharging *that* hypothesis is precisely the surface
left `sorry` here.

/- **Uniform-in-Λ spectral gap for the YM Hamiltonian.**

There exists a strictly positive `δ₀` such that for every lattice
cutoff `Λ : ℕ`, the spectral gap `Δ_Λ` of the cutoff Hamiltonian
satisfies `Δ_Λ ≥ δ₀`. Stated here as the bare quantifier shape
`∃ δ₀ > 0, ∀ Λ : ℕ, δ₀ ≤ δ₀`; the *vacuous-tautology* body is
intentional — a real `Δ_Λ` lives in a Hilbert-space spectral
predicate the Towers scaffold has not yet exposed, and the
honest surface is the **quantifier order**, not the inequality
body. Proof is `sorry` — discharging the uniform-in-Λ surface is
the Clay mass-gap content and is far outside the Towers scope. -/
/-- The named-open analytic surface behind `gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2`: the
uniform-in-Λ spectral-gap quantifier shape. Stated as a `Prop`, NOT discharged
with `by sorry`. Discharging the uniform-in-Λ surface is the Clay mass-gap
content and stays OPEN. -/
