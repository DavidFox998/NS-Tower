Towers / NS / EnergyV2  (Batch 8 Track 2)

**Unblocking the real `E(t) ≤ E(0)` energy inequality.**

Five bricks named exactly per the Batch 8 directive, plus one
tripwire theorem (active per directive but NOT registered in
`scripts/check-towers.sh` — its compilation alone enforces the
tripwire because flipping `Dissipation` to a non-zero body breaks
the `add_zero` step inside the proof):

  1. `H1Norm_v2` — placeholder upgrade target for the Task #51
     `H1Norm`. Currently defined as the literal alias
     `H1Norm_v2 u t := H1Norm u t`, with a TODO naming the
     intended `L²` replacement.
  2. `Dissipation` — explicit zero placeholder for the
     gradient-energy term `‖∇u(t)‖_{L²}²`. Honest stand-in until
     `fderiv ℝ (u t)` plus an `MemLp 2` packaging lands.
  3. `Dissipation_nonneg` — `0 ≤ Dissipation u t`. Currently
     trivial (RHS = 0); the statement honestly anticipates the
     `sq_nonneg`-shaped proof a real `‖∇u‖_{L²}²` upgrade will
     need.
  4. `ViscosityScaling` — `ν * Dissipation u t`. Names the coupling
     constant `ν` and reserves the slot for the real viscosity
     scaling in front of the dissipation term.
  5. `EnergyDissipationIntegral` — `ν * t * Dissipation u 0`, the
     rectangle-rule stand-in for `ν * ∫₀ᵗ ‖∇u(s)‖_{L²}² ds`.
     Avoids importing `MeasureTheory.Integral.IntervalIntegral`
     while preserving the linear-in-`t` shape downstream
     `LerayEnergyIneq` arguments need.

Plus supporting:

  * `LerayEnergyIneq ν u u₀ : Prop` — the named
    `½ ‖u(t)‖² + ν ∫₀ᵗ ‖∇u‖² ds ≤ ½ ‖u₀(0)‖²` shape on the
    placeholders. Real `Prop` over real arithmetic.
  * `LerayEnergyIneq_dissipation_zero_simplifies` — the active
    tripwire. Currently `LerayEnergyIneq ν u u₀ ↔ ∀ t,
    ½ (H1Norm u t)² ≤ ½ (H1Norm u₀ 0)²` because the dissipation
    term collapses to zero. Flipping `Dissipation` to any
    non-zero body intentionally breaks the `add_zero` step in
    the proof, signalling that a real dissipation term has landed
    and the Leray-Hopf surface needs a real proof of monotonicity
    against the dissipation.

### Honest scope

What this file claims:

  * `H1Norm_v2` is the *alias* `H1Norm` (the Task #51 placeholder
    Euclidean norm of `u t 0`). NOT the real H¹ Sobolev norm,
    NOT an `L²` norm — explicit alias awaiting a future
    refactor.
  * `Dissipation` is the literal zero function. NOT the real
    dissipation `ν ‖∇u(t)‖_{L²}²`, NOT an `L²` gradient norm.
  * `ViscosityScaling` is `ν * 0 = 0` definitionally; the
    coupling constant `ν` is genuinely quantified.
  * `EnergyDissipationIntegral` is `ν * t * 0 = 0` definitionally
    on the placeholder. NOT a real Lebesgue integral, NOT the
    Leray-Hopf cumulative dissipation.
  * `LerayEnergyIneq` is a real `Prop` over real arithmetic; its
    *content* is the placeholder schema, not the Clay
    conjecture's energy inequality.
  * `LerayEnergyIneq_dissipation_zero_simplifies` is a genuine
    `Iff` and the tripwire mechanism: the proof closes only
    because `Dissipation = 0`. Any non-zero upgrade breaks it.

What this file does NOT claim:

  * The Leray-Hopf energy inequality
    `½ ‖u(t)‖_{L²}² + ν ∫₀ᵗ ‖∇u‖_{L²}² ds ≤ ½ ‖u₀‖_{L²}²`;
  * Any actual NS time-evolution operator (no `Φ_t` is constructed);
  * NS global regularity, weak-strong uniqueness, or any other
    Clay-style result.

NS tower status unchanged: **Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3).

### Zero shared imports

This file imports only `Towers.NS.EnergyIneq` (the Task #51 / #56
/ #62 / #69 / #70 NS schema foundation). It does NOT import
`Towers.Spectral.OperatorV2` or `Towers.YM.Spectrum` — the other
two Batch 8 tracks are independent and run in parallel.

/-! ### Schema defs (5) — one per Batch 8 directive item -/

/-- **Brick 1 (`H1Norm_v2`).** Placeholder-upgrade target for
the Task #51 `H1Norm`. Currently the literal alias
`H1Norm_v2 u t := H1Norm u t`. The aliasing is intentional: it
reserves the `_v2` name for the real Sobolev / `L²` replacement
without forcing a rename of every downstream caller when the
upgrade lands.

TODO (mathlib v4.13+): replace the body with
`(∫ x, ‖u t x‖^2 ∂volume).sqrt` on `MeasureTheory.MemLp 2`. -/
noncomputable def H1Norm_v2 (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  H1Norm u t

/-- **Brick 2 (`Dissipation`).** Placeholder gradient-energy term.
Currently the literal zero function. Honest stand-in for
`‖∇u(t)‖_{L²}²` until `fderiv ℝ (u t)` plus an `MemLp 2` packaging
lands.

TODO (mathlib v4.13+): replace the body with
`∫ x, ‖fderiv ℝ (u t) x‖^2 ∂volume` on `MeasureTheory.MemLp 2`. -/
def Dissipation (_u : VelocityField) (_t : ℝ) : ℝ := 0

/-- **Brick 3 (`Dissipation_nonneg`).** `0 ≤ Dissipation u t`.
Currently trivial because the placeholder body is `0`. The
statement honestly anticipates the `sq_nonneg`-shaped proof a real
`‖∇u‖_{L²}²` upgrade will need; updating the body to a real
integral of squared norms keeps this brick provable via
`integral_nonneg` + `sq_nonneg`. -/
theorem Dissipation_nonneg (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) :
    0 ≤ Dissipation u t := by
  unfold Dissipation
  exact le_refl 0

/-- **Brick 4 (`ViscosityScaling`).** Names the coupling-constant
scaling `ν * Dissipation u t`. Reserves the slot for the
viscosity coefficient in front of the dissipation term in the
Leray-Hopf inequality. On the current placeholder
(`Dissipation = 0`) this is `ν * 0 = 0` definitionally. -/
noncomputable def ViscosityScaling
    (ν : ℝ) (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ν * Dissipation u t

/-- **Brick 5 (`EnergyDissipationIntegral`).** Rectangle-rule
stand-in for `ν * ∫₀ᵗ ‖∇u(s)‖_{L²}² ds`. Defined as
`ν * t * Dissipation u 0` to preserve the linear-in-`t` shape
downstream `LerayEnergyIneq` arguments need without importing
`MeasureTheory.Integral.IntervalIntegral`. On the current
placeholder (`Dissipation = 0`) this is `ν * t * 0 = 0`
definitionally.

TODO (mathlib v4.13+): replace the body with
`ν * ∫ s in (0 : ℝ)..t, Dissipation u s` via `intervalIntegral`. -/
noncomputable def EnergyDissipationIntegral
    (ν : ℝ) (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ν * t * Dissipation u 0

/-! ### Supporting: `LerayEnergyIneq` + active tripwire -/

/-- **Placeholder-flavoured Leray-Hopf energy inequality.**
`∀ t, ½ (H1Norm u t)² + EnergyDissipationIntegral ν u t
≤ ½ (H1Norm u₀ 0)²`. Real `Prop` over real arithmetic on the
Task #51 / Batch 8 placeholders. NOT the Leray-Hopf energy
inequality — `H1Norm` is the Task #51 placeholder, `Dissipation`
is the Batch 8 zero placeholder, `EnergyDissipationIntegral` is
the rectangle-rule stand-in. -/
def LerayEnergyIneq (ν : ℝ) (u u₀ : VelocityField) : Prop :=
  ∀ t : ℝ,
    (1 / 2) * (H1Norm u t) ^ 2 + EnergyDissipationIntegral ν u t
      ≤ (1 / 2) * (H1Norm u₀ 0) ^ 2

/-- **Active tripwire — directive: `Tripwire active`.**

With the current `Dissipation = 0` placeholder, the
`EnergyDissipationIntegral` term in `LerayEnergyIneq` collapses,
so the predicate degenerates to a pointwise `H1Norm` square
inequality. The `Iff` is provable now because `add_zero` discharges
the dissipation column; flipping `Dissipation` to any non-zero body
(`ν ‖∇u‖_{L²}²`, or even a non-trivial stand-in like
`fun u t => 1`) intentionally breaks the proof, signalling that a
real dissipation term has landed and the Leray-Hopf surface needs
a real proof of monotonicity against the dissipation. -/

/-! ### Batch 9 (5) — real (non-zero) dissipation track

Adds a SECOND dissipation surface (`Dissipation_real`) and a
SECOND Leray-flavoured energy inequality (`LerayEnergyIneq_real`)
that uses it, **without touching** the Batch 8 `Dissipation`
(`= 0`) or its `LerayEnergyIneq_dissipation_zero_simplifies`
tripwire above. The tripwire stays green; the new track exposes
the "real" shape that downstream work can specialise.

**Honest scope.** None of these advance the NS tower past
`Status: Open`. They prove only:

  * `H1Norm_real` — squared placeholder H¹-norm `(‖u t 0‖)²`.
    NOT the real L² spatial integral.
  * `Dissipation_real` — non-zero placeholder dissipation
    `(‖u t 0‖)²`. Shape of `ν ‖∇u‖_{L²}²`, NOT the gradient
    L² norm.
  * `LerayEnergyIneq_real` — `Prop` shape
    `½ E(t) + ∫ D ≤ ½ E(0)` over the new defs. No proof —
    the Leray-Hopf inequality is **not** proved here.
  * `Dissipation_positive_ae` — `0 ≤ Dissipation_real u t` via
    `mul_self_nonneg`.
  * `EnergyDecayBound` — `0 ≤ H1Norm_real u t`; trivial lower
    bound on the squared placeholder, NOT a real decay theorem. -/

/-- **Brick (`H1Norm_real`).** Squared placeholder H¹-norm:
`(H1Norm u t)²` written as `H1Norm u t * H1Norm u t`. Real,
non-negative, deterministic function of `(u, t)`. NOT the L²
spatial integral of `|∇u|²`; just the square of the Task #51
placeholder evaluated at the spatial origin. -/
noncomputable def H1Norm_real (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  H1Norm u t * H1Norm u t

/-- **Brick (`Dissipation_real`).** Non-zero placeholder dissipation,
shaped like `‖∇u‖²_{L²}` but using the Task #51 placeholder norm
in place of a real gradient. Concretely `H1Norm u t * H1Norm u t`.
NOT the L² norm of the velocity gradient; just a non-negative real
that downstream `LerayEnergyIneq_real` can refer to. The Batch 8
`Dissipation = 0` placeholder above is intentionally NOT changed
so the existing `LerayEnergyIneq_dissipation_zero_simplifies`
tripwire stays compileable. -/
noncomputable def Dissipation_real (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  H1Norm u t * H1Norm u t

/-- **Brick (`LerayEnergyIneq_real`).** Leray-flavoured energy
inequality over the *real* (non-zero) dissipation placeholder:
`∀ t, ½ H1Norm_real u t + ν * t * Dissipation_real u 0
     ≤ ½ H1Norm_real u₀ 0`. A real `Prop` over real arithmetic on
the Batch 9 placeholders. **Not proved here** — the inequality is
the Clay-flavoured target, not a theorem on placeholders. NOT the
Leray-Hopf energy inequality; the constituent norms are
placeholders. -/
def LerayEnergyIneq_real (ν : ℝ) (u u₀ : VelocityField) : Prop :=
  ∀ t : ℝ,
    (1 / 2) * H1Norm_real u t + ν * t * Dissipation_real u 0
      ≤ (1 / 2) * H1Norm_real u₀ 0

/-- **Brick (`Dissipation_positive_ae`).** Pointwise non-negativity
of the Batch 9 `Dissipation_real` placeholder at every `(u, t)`.
Via `mul_self_nonneg`, since the body is `x * x`. Honest scope:
this is non-negativity of the *placeholder*, not the "almost
everywhere" positivity of a real dissipation density. -/
theorem Dissipation_positive_ae (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) :
    0 ≤ Dissipation_real u t := by
  unfold Dissipation_real
  exact mul_self_nonneg _

/-- **Brick (`EnergyDecayBound`).** Trivial pointwise lower bound on
the Batch 9 squared placeholder H¹-norm: `0 ≤ H1Norm_real u t`.
Honest scope: this is *not* a decay theorem; it's the floor of the
squared placeholder, available unconditionally via
`mul_self_nonneg`. A real energy-decay statement would require the
Leray-Hopf inequality, which is `LerayEnergyIneq_real` above and
is **not** proved. -/
theorem EnergyDecayBound (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) :
    0 ≤ H1Norm_real u t := by
  unfold H1Norm_real
  exact mul_self_nonneg _

/-! ### Batch 10 (5) — global-regularity scaffolds (BKM + small-data)

Five bricks naming the two classical paths to NS global regularity:
the Beale-Kato-Majda continuation criterion (vorticity-Linfty
blow-up controls regularity) and the small-data (Fujita-Kato) global
existence theorem. Both are NAMED schemas here — `Prop` predicates
parameterized over the placeholder `VelocityField` surface, not
proved. The `Enstrophy` brick adds a third non-zero placeholder
(distinct from `H1Norm_real` and `Dissipation_real`), and
`EnstrophyBalance` / `EnergyEnstrophy_interpolation` name the two
balance / interpolation shapes the BKM proof depends on.

**Honest scope.** NS tower stays **Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3).
None of these are proofs; they are schema-level Prop predicates
plus one placeholder def. The Batch 8 `Dissipation = 0` tripwire
(`LerayEnergyIneq_dissipation_zero_simplifies`) is intentionally
untouched. -/

/-- **Brick (`Enstrophy`).** Placeholder enstrophy
`E(t) := ½ ‖ω(t)‖_{L²}²` (where `ω = curl u` is the vorticity).
Currently `Enstrophy u t := H1Norm u t * H1Norm u t * (1 / 2)` —
the squared placeholder H¹-norm scaled by `½`, since mathlib v4.12.0
does not provide a vorticity operator on plain `VelocityField`.
Non-negative real. NOT the real `L²` norm of `curl u`; honest
stand-in for the global-regularity track. -/
noncomputable def Enstrophy (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  H1Norm u t * H1Norm u t * (1 / 2)

/-- **Schema (`EnstrophyBalance`).** Prop predicate "enstrophy
satisfies the differential balance"
`E(t) = E(0) − 2ν ∫₀ᵗ ‖∇ω(s)‖_{L²}² ds + ∫₀ᵗ ⟨ω⊗ω, ∇u⟩ ds`.
Here on the placeholder it reduces to the equality
`Enstrophy u t = Enstrophy u 0` (i.e. constant in `t`), reflecting
the absence of a real vortex-stretching term. Real Prop on the
placeholder; **not** the real Constantin-Foias enstrophy balance.
The unconditional `EnstrophyBalance u ν` is NOT proved here. -/
def EnstrophyBalance (u : VelocityField) (_ν : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ t : ℝ, Enstrophy u t = Enstrophy u 0

/-- **Schema (`BealeKatoMajda_criterion_schema`).** Named Prop
predicate for the Beale-Kato-Majda continuation criterion: a smooth
NS solution on `[0, T)` extends to `T` iff
`∫₀ᵀ ‖ω(s)‖_{L^∞} ds < ∞`. On the placeholder this is rendered as
the implication
`(∀ t < T, Enstrophy u t ≤ M) → ∀ t ≤ T, Enstrophy u t ≤ M` —
the "uniform-bound continuation" *shape*, not the BKM theorem.
Real Prop over real arithmetic; the implication is NOT proved here
(would require local existence + uniform bound continuation, both
out of scope on placeholders). NS tower stays Open. -/
def BealeKatoMajda_criterion_schema
    (u : VelocityField) (T M : ℝ) : Prop :=
  (∀ t : ℝ, t < T → Enstrophy u t ≤ M) →
    ∀ t : ℝ, t ≤ T → Enstrophy u t ≤ M

/-- **Schema (`SmallDataGlobal_schema`).** Named Prop predicate for
Fujita-Kato small-data global existence: if the initial H¹-norm
`H1Norm u₀ 0` is below an explicit threshold `δ > 0`, the solution
exists globally with `H1Norm u t` bounded by a universal multiple
of `H1Norm u₀ 0` for all `t`. On the placeholder this is the
implication shape
`H1Norm u₀ 0 ≤ δ → ∀ t, H1Norm u t ≤ 2 * H1Norm u₀ 0` over
arbitrary `(u, u₀, δ)`. Real Prop over real arithmetic; NOT proved
here — would require the contraction-mapping argument in critical
Besov / Sobolev space which mathlib v4.12.0 does not surface. -/
def SmallDataGlobal_schema
    (u u₀ : VelocityField) (δ : ℝ) : Prop :=
  H1Norm u₀ 0 ≤ δ →
    ∀ t : ℝ, H1Norm u t ≤ 2 * H1Norm u₀ 0

/-- **Schema (`EnergyEnstrophy_interpolation`).** Named Prop
predicate for the standard interpolation inequality coupling
energy and enstrophy:
`‖u‖_{L^∞}² ≤ C * ‖u‖_{L²} * ‖∇u‖_{L²}` (Agmon / Sobolev in 3D),
which yields `H1Norm_real u t ≤ C * (Enstrophy u t) * (H1Norm u t)`
after squaring and re-grouping the placeholders. Real Prop with
universal `C` quantifier; the inequality is NOT proved here —
genuine Sobolev embedding theorems on placeholders are out of
scope. Honest scope: this NAMES the interpolation step the BKM
proof depends on, without supplying it. -/
def EnergyEnstrophy_interpolation (u : VelocityField) (t : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∃ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C ∧
    H1Norm_real u t ≤ C * Enstrophy u t * H1Norm u t

/-! ### Batch 11 (5) — small-data global existence track

Five bricks that promote the Batch 10 BKM / Fujita-Kato scaffolding
one step toward an existence witness:

  1. `Enstrophy_bound_from_small_data` — combinator: from a
     `SmallDataGlobal_schema u u₀ δ` hypothesis with `H1Norm u₀ 0 ≤
     δ`, derive a quadratic Enstrophy bound `Enstrophy u t ≤
     2 * (H1Norm u₀ 0) * (H1Norm u₀ 0)`. Real algebra on the
     placeholder; the bound is the squared Fujita-Kato bound on
     `H1Norm u t` times the `½` in `Enstrophy`'s definition, scaled
     up — schema-level, NOT the real enstrophy bound from PDE
     analysis.
  2. `BealeKatoMajda_implies_global` — combinator: from a
     `BealeKatoMajda_criterion_schema u T M` hypothesis AND the
     uniform Enstrophy bound, conclude `∀ t ≤ T, Enstrophy u t ≤ M`.
     Schema → result bridge; this is BKM elimination on the
     placeholder, NOT a proof of BKM itself.
  3. `SmallDataGlobal_proven` — actually PROVE
     `SmallDataGlobal_schema 0 0 δ` for any `δ`, the zero velocity
     field. With `H1Norm 0 t = 0` for all `t` (via Task #51's
     `H1Norm_zero`), the implication chain collapses: `0 ≤ δ →
     ∀ t, 0 ≤ 2 * 0` is `True`. Honest scope: trivial-on-zero
     witness; NOT the real Fujita-Kato theorem.
  4. `Energy_decay_exponential` — NAMED Prop schema for
     `∃ C η, 0 < η ∧ H1Norm u t ≤ C * Real.exp (-η * t)`. NOT
     proved — exponential decay needs a real dissipation
     mechanism which the placeholder does not have.
  5. `LerayHopf_weak_solution_exists` — NAMED Prop schema for
     existence of a Leray-Hopf weak solution: `∃ u, EnergyMonotone
     u u₀`. NOT proved — existence of weak solutions on the
     placeholder surface is out of scope.

**Tripwire active (directive Track 2).** Since
`BealeKatoMajda_implies_global` is a combinator that takes
`BealeKatoMajda_criterion_schema` as a hypothesis (NOT a proof of
the criterion itself), `SmallDataGlobal_proven` is restricted to
the vacuous-on-zero case. Both honestly reflect that BKM and
Fujita-Kato remain unproven on the placeholder. NS tower stays
**Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). -/

/-- **Brick (`Enstrophy_bound_from_small_data`).** Combinator: from
`SmallDataGlobal_schema u u₀ δ` AND `H1Norm u₀ 0 ≤ δ`, derive the
quadratic enstrophy bound `Enstrophy u t ≤ 2 * H1Norm u₀ 0 * H1Norm
u₀ 0` (the squared `2 * H1Norm u₀ 0` Fujita-Kato bound, times
`½` from `Enstrophy`'s definition, gives `2 * (H1Norm u₀ 0)²`). Real
algebra: square the supplied `H1Norm u t ≤ 2 * H1Norm u₀ 0` bound
via `mul_le_mul` (both sides non-negative) and absorb the `(1/2)`
factor. Honest scope: this is the *placeholder* bound on the
placeholder Enstrophy; NOT the real Fujita-Kato enstrophy bound
from PDE analysis. -/

/-- **Brick (`BealeKatoMajda_implies_global`).** Combinator: from

implication "uniform bound on `[0, T)` extends to `[0, T]`") AND a
uniform Enstrophy bound on `[0, T)`, conclude the uniform bound on
`[0, T]`. Direct application of the schema. Honest scope: this is
BKM *elimination* on the placeholder — given the schema's
implication, apply it — NOT a proof of the BKM criterion itself.

field as both initial data and solution. With `H1Norm (0 :

implication is `0 ≤ δ → ∀ t, 0 ≤ 2 * 0`, both sides identically
`0`. Honest scope: trivial-on-zero witness; NOT the real
Fujita-Kato global existence theorem. The directive's Track 2
tripwire ("if BKM fails, SmallDataGlobal must be schema") is
honored: this brick proves the schema only on the zero field, the

predicate for existence of a Leray-Hopf weak solution to NS with
initial data `u₀`: `∃ u, EnergyMonotone u u₀`. Real Prop; NOT

/-! ### Batch 12 (2026-05-26) — Track 2: small-data global existence

Five bricks. Two real theorems on **constant velocity fields** (the
honest placeholder analogue of "no advection, no dissipation"),
and three NAMED Prop schemas for shapes the placeholder cannot
discharge. Tripwire honored: `BealeKatoMajda_criterion` IS promoted
to a real theorem, but **only** on the zero velocity field, so
`SmallDataGlobal_nonzero` is correspondingly restricted to the

/-- **Brick (`SmallDataGlobal_nonzero`).** Real theorem proving
`SmallDataGlobal_schema (fun _ _ => v) (fun _ _ => v) ‖v‖` for any
`v : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`. Witnesses the schema on a
**constant-in-time** velocity field, which is genuinely non-zero
for `v ≠ 0`. The schema unfolds to `‖v‖ ≤ ‖v‖ → ∀ t, ‖v‖ ≤ 2 * ‖v‖`,
which closes by `0 ≤ ‖v‖` (`norm_nonneg`). Honest scope: this is
the **second** real witness for `SmallDataGlobal_schema` (Batch 11
proved it on zero); the constant-field surface has no advection or
dissipation, so the bound is vacuous — NOT real Fujita-Kato
contraction in critical Besov space. -/

/-- **Schema (`Enstrophy_bound_global`).** Named Prop predicate for
the **global enstrophy bound** `∫₀^∞ ‖∇u(s)‖_{L²}² ds ≤ C * ‖u₀‖_{H¹}²`
that small-data Fujita-Kato yields. On the placeholder rendered as
`∃ C ≥ 0, ∀ t, Enstrophy u t ≤ C * H1Norm u₀ 0` (the placeholder
has no time integral; the bound is pointwise-in-`t` rather than
integrated). Real Prop; NOT proved here — would require a real
dissipation mechanism the placeholder lacks. NS tower stays Open. -/

  ∃ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C ∧ ∀ t : ℝ, Enstrophy u t ≤ C * H1Norm u₀ 0

/-- **Schema (`Energy_decay_optimal`).** Named Prop predicate for
**optimal algebraic energy decay** `E(t) ≤ C / (1 + t)²` (Schonbek
1985 sharp rate for NS in ℝ³ under decay assumptions on the data).
Real Prop over real arithmetic; NOT proved here — algebraic decay
requires a Fourier-side argument on the dissipative semigroup,
out of scope on the placeholder. Companion to Batch 11's
`Energy_decay_exponential` (the exponential-decay analogue). NS
tower stays Open. -/
def Energy_decay_optimal (u : VelocityField) : Prop :=
  ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ t : ℝ, 0 ≤ t → H1Norm u t ≤ C / (1 + t) ^ 2

/-- **Brick (`BealeKatoMajda_criterion`).** Real theorem proving
`BealeKatoMajda_criterion_schema (0 : VelocityField) T M` for any
`T` and any `M ≥ 0`. The zero velocity field has
`Enstrophy 0 t = 0` for all `t` (via Task #56's `H1Norm_zero`), so
the schema's implication trivially holds. Honest scope (tripwire
mode): the BKM schema is promoted to a real theorem ONLY on the
zero velocity field — the implication shape is correct, the
**witness** is the trivial-on-zero case. NOT the real BKM
continuation criterion (which requires local existence in `H^s`,
out of scope on the placeholder). Track-2 tripwire: this is why
`SmallDataGlobal_nonzero` is restricted to constant fields. -/

/-- **Schema (`LerayHopf_unique`).** Named Prop predicate for
**uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf weak solution** under small initial
data: `∀ u u', EnergyMonotone u u₀ → EnergyMonotone u' u₀ → u = u'`.
Real Prop; FALSE in general on the placeholder (any two velocity
fields satisfying the energy bound trivially satisfy the
premise, but there is no NS evolution to force them equal), so the
schema is unproved. Honest scope: uniqueness of Leray-Hopf is open
even in 3D as an unconditional theorem; the schema NAMES the shape
the conjectural uniqueness proof would have. NS tower stays Open. -/
