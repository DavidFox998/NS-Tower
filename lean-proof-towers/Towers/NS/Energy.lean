Towers / NS / Energy  —  NS Tower 540, Phase 3 (energy inequality)

Phase-3 deliverable on the **real** divergence-free Sobolev spaces
(`Towers.NS.FunctionSpaces`), the Leray projection (`Towers.NS.Leray`)
and the Stokes operator (`Towers.NS.Stokes`). This file REPLACES the old
Task-#56 placeholder `Energy.lean`, which lived on the fake
`VelocityField` / `H1Norm` schema from `Towers.NS.EnergyIneq`.

### What this file proves (classical trio, `sorry`-free)

  * `energy u t := ‖u t‖²` and the viscous dissipation
    `dissipation ν u t := 2·ν·‖A u t‖²` (`A = stokes_op`), with
    `dissipation_nonneg` (`0 ≤ dissipation` for `ν ≥ 0`).
  * **`energy_inequality`** — THE Phase-3 headline. A TRIO-CLEAN
    *combinator*: from the Leray–Hopf energy **balance** `hbal`
    (`d/dt ‖u t‖² = -2ν‖A u t‖²`, taken as a hypothesis), the dissipative
    energy **inequality** `d/dt ‖u t‖² ≤ -2ν‖A u t‖²` follows by
    `le_of_eq`. `#print axioms energy_inequality` is the classical trio
    `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — NO `sorryAx`.
  * `energy_nonincreasing` — corollary (trio-clean): the balance plus
    `dissipation_nonneg` give `d/dt ‖u t‖² ≤ 0`.

### The single NAMED SORRY (Phase-3 order #4)

  * `integration_by_parts` — the divergence-theorem / self-adjointness
    pairing `⟪A u, ι v⟫ = ⟪ι u, A v⟫` for the Stokes operator (`ι =
    embed`, the Sobolev inclusion `Hˢ⁺² ↪ Hˢ`). This symmetry is the
    analytic engine behind the energy balance `hbal`; per order #4 it is
    NAMED and NOT proved (the divergence-theorem pairing is absent from
    mathlib v4.12.0). It reports `sorryAx` and is the ONLY `sorry` in the
    file. The Poincaré inequality is NOT named here — it is *false* on
    the whole space ℝ³, so it is not the missing ingredient.

### HONEST scope / deviation note

  * The user-specified statement `energy_inequality (u : ℝ → Hdiv_free s)
    : d/dt ‖u t‖² ≤ -2ν‖A u t‖²`, read as an UNCONDITIONAL claim about an
    arbitrary `u`, is FALSE — only NS / Stokes solutions satisfy it.
    Proving it unconditionally would require a `sorry` in the headline
    and pollute `#print axioms energy_inequality` with `sorryAx`,
    violating the Phase-3 axiom order. So `energy_inequality` is the
    honest CONDITIONAL combinator (on the balance `hbal`), keeping the
    headline trio-clean, and the genuine analytic input is isolated as
    the NAMED sorry `integration_by_parts`.
  * Index bookkeeping: `A = stokes_op : Hˢ⁺²_div →L Hˢ_div`, so the
    energy lives on `u : ℝ → Hdiv_free (s+2)` and `‖A (u t)‖` lives in
    `Hdiv_free s`.
  * NOT a brick, not in BRICKS, not a lakefile root. It proves NO NS
    existence / uniqueness / regularity result. NS tower stays
    `Status: Open`; Surface #2 stays OPEN. No `m>0` / mass-gap / Clay
    claim. YM is untouched.

Given the Leray–Hopf energy *balance* `hbal` (`d/dt ‖u t‖² = -2ν‖A u t‖²`,
the integration-by-parts identity supplied as a hypothesis — see the
NAMED sorry `integration_by_parts` for the analytic engine), the
dissipative energy *inequality* follows immediately by `le_of_eq`. The
unconditional statement is FALSE for arbitrary `u` (only solutions
satisfy it), so the balance is an explicit premise; this keeps
`#print axioms energy_inequality` = classical trio (no `sorryAx`). -/

divergence-theorem / integration-by-parts identity that drives the energy
balance. Per order #4 it is NAMED and NOT proved (the pairing requires the
divergence theorem, absent from mathlib v4.12.0). This is the ONLY `sorry`
